<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Image binarization refers to the process of converting a given grayscale or color document image in a manner that desired details of the original image are preserved in the binary image.</p>
<p><em>What we aimed to achieve</em>: A investigation into the existing solutions to the problem allowed us to see that the existing solutions were such that they were tailored to specific document types and tended to not work as well on input image types to which they had not been tailored. We aimed to devise a solution which worked with a greater consistency than existing solutions for a variety of input image types.</p>
<p><em>Why it is an important problem</em>: Most document analysis such as classification or text from non-text, character, word and line segmentation and recognition tasks require that the input image be binary. The performance of these higher level tasks therefore depend on how good the initial binarization process is. This makes the binarization task an important one.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scope">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Scope</a></h2>
<p>The project involved the study of document image binarization schemes, the
implementation of binarization schemes in the existing literature, development
of a binarization method for printed color document images and the evaluation
of the proposed binarization scheme using certain standard evaluation metrics
as well a system level evaluation using the Tesseract OCR.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="solutions-implemented">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Solutions Implemented</a></h2>
<p><em>Existing solutions</em>: Solutions from the literature that we implemented were those by <a class="reference external" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5583364&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5583364">Kuo et al</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6065269&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6065269">Su et al</a>. In addition to these more complex solutions the simpler classic methods we implemented were those of <a class="reference external" href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=4901">Niblack</a> , <a class="reference external" href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320399000552">Sauvola</a> and <a class="reference external" href="ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1048482&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1048482">Wolf</a>.</p>
<p><em>Proposed solution</em>:  The binarization solution makes use of a color reduction step by means of the <a class="reference external" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1000236&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1000236">mean shift</a> algorithm performed at different <a class="reference external" href="http://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/RCA84.pdf">scales</a> of the image followed an enhanced version of the Niblack’s thresholding method that was proposed (detailed in the thesis) for binarization of printed color document images with complex backgrounds and historical degraded document images. The binarization is followed by a optional morphological post-processing step.</p>
<p>You can examine some of the results of the proposed solution here: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rj99f4x5dn13laa/AADHkOjVs04q90xoIKYLupOQa?dl=0">Binarization Results Album</a></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="implementation">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Implementation</a></h2>
<p>The binarization schemes were implemented majorly in C (using the OpenCV library) and the evaluation code consisted of MATLAB, Python, Batch scripts and a standard evaluation tool provided by the International Conference on Document Analysis and Recognition (ICDAR).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="evaluations">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">Evaluations</a></h2>
<p>The proposed solution was evaluated using certain standard metrics used in the
Document Image Binarization Contest (<a class="reference external" href="http://utopia.duth.gr/~ipratika/DIBCO2013/">DIBCO</a>) competitions conducted as part
of the ICDAR. The proposed solution was found to perform at-least at par with
or better than the state of the art on average. In addition the proposed method
was also found to perform more consistently than the state of the art in all
instances of our evaluation.</p>
<p>The proposed solution was also evaluated as part of a whole OCR system
and found to raise overall character recognition accuracy by 1.94% as compared to Sauvola’s thresholding method that also aims to binarize
degraded document images or document images with complex backgrounds</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conclusions">
<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Conclusions</a></h2>
<p>In the course of this study the one concrete conclusion that we arrive at is
that a single binarization scheme that may succeed at all kinds of input images
may be a an unreasonable goal. However, it is indeed a achievable goal to be
able to reduce the variability of performance of a given binarization scheme on
a more closer set of input document images.</p>
